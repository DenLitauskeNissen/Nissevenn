Ah, the day has come

Yes, the final one:
---

<p align="center">
_The first word_

_Of every day_

_The end is close_

_You must not stray_
<br>
<br>
_One rarely looks at it_

_From this angle_

_One rarely reads_

_Words that have been tangled_
<br>
<br>
_Itâ€™s close_

_But still far_

_Who knows_

_Maybe the lid is ajar?_
<p>
